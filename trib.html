      <h2>biography</h2>
        <p>
          The Young and talented right-handed batsman, Virat Kohli was born on the 5th of November in 1988 in Delhi. His father was Prem Kohli and his mother Saroj Kohli. His father worked as a lawyer and he passed away in December 19th, 2006 due to brain stroke. Virat has an elder brother, Vikash and an elder sister, Bhavna. He had his schooling in St. Sofia School in Paschim Vihar, Delhi.
Virat Kohli was among the first intake of The West Delhi Cricket Academy which was created in 1998. Virat was included in the Delhi Ranji team on 23rd November 2006. He played his first match against Tamil Nadu. Virat became famous when he played for Delhi in the Ranji trophy, a match against Karnataka. He scored 90 in that match. On that day only (19th December 2006), at 3 o’clock in the morning, his dad passed away due to brain stroke.

        <h2>ABOUT THE KING</h2>
        <p>  
            ☛ Virat, a 13-year-old, is selected for the Delhi Under-15 team for the Polly Umrigar Trophy in October. He ends the campaign as Delhi's leading scorer.<br><br>  
            ☛ Virat is chosen for the India Under-19 team for the first time after making an impression at the youth level for Delhi. He then had a fantastic tour of England, averaging over 100 in the one-day series.<br><br>  
            ☛ In Malaysia's Under-19 World Cup, Virat led India to win and finished the competition as one of the top three run scorers. His innate leadership abilities attracted the proper kind of attention.<br><br>  
            ☛ Royal Challengers Bangalore, an IPL team, signs Virat on a youngster contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs when he is still a minor.  
            <br><br> ☛ Virat received his maiden call-up to the Indian ODI team and participated in the entire five-match series against Sri Lanka on the road. In the fourth game of the series, he hit his first 50, a 54-run inning.   
            <br><br> ☛ When Virat got his first ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111, it was worth the wait for him to return to the national squad.  
            <br><br> ☛ Virat participated in every game of India's victorious World Cup campaign in 2011, scoring his only century against Bangladesh in the opening match. Despite the fact that he didn't exactly light up the tournament with his bat, his final-round remark to Sachin has since become legendary in cricket: "Sachin Tendulkar has carried the weight of the nation for 21 years." Time for us to carry him on our shoulders  
            <br><br> ☛ Every cricketer will answer "play Test cricket" when asked what their dream is. In 2011, Virat finally had the opportunity to play in his first Test match against the West Indies. Unfortunately for the charming lad, it was a forgettable experience as he scored just 19 runs in the two innings he played.  
            <br><br> ☛ In the fourth and final test against Australia in Adelaide, Kohli achieved his first test hundred under somewhat dramatic circumstances. He just avoided being run out when batting with Ishant Sharma and nearly ran out of partners. However, he was unable to save India. 4-0 was our series loss.  
            <br><br> ☛ Virat led India to the CB Series final in Australia with what is undoubtedly one of the best ODI efforts by an Indian batsman, hitting 133 not out against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls. Hobart witnessed one of the greatest batting performances in history as India, who was chasing 321, reached the score in 37 overs.  
            <br><br> ☛ In place of an injured MS Dhoni, Virat was selected the stand-in ODI captain when India visited the West Indies. Earlier that year, he had also been named captain of his IPL team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.
